* The project

API was meant to be similar to PyTorch except one big difference. The library isn't as dynamic as PyTorch. We use the term =Compute_Graph= to do operations on tensors.

* Samples

** tensors

Shows basic usage of tensors.

** grad

Shows how to do automatic differentiation.

** MNIST digit classification

Shows how to build real neural network. The network's architecture was taken from =3Blue1Brown='s video.
With =lr=0.001=, =batch_size=50= and =epochs=2= the model achieves *84.5%* accuracy.

* Roadmap

 - more loss functions: cross entropy especially
 - make C++ API more fancier
 - more gates: convolution etc.
 - fast tensor operations using AVX-512
 - (probably won't happen) GPU implementation using API Vulkan
